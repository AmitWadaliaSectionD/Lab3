    <h2>Q1</h2>
    <p>I believe creating a cohesive theme enhances the user experience by letting users feel like its all one singular site and not confusing them with different colors and backgrounds.</p><br>
    <h2>Q2</h2>
    <p>I believe the key considerations when designing forms for users are convenience and functionality the former so they aren't frustrated when filling out the form and the latter so that it actually works for them.</p><br>
    <h2>Q3</h2>
    <p>I believe multimedia content can help improve the engagement and information value of a blog post by allowing users to get their information in a variety of ways some of which may work better for certain people. Some people might be better visual learners and so a video or images might help better and some people might work better just listening so audio might be better for them</p>
